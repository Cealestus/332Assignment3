The testing for Part B highlights the functionality of the dog wash program. The Create: DogX part indicates that a dog is about to be added to a wash.
The Creating: DogX indicates that a dog is currently being created.
The In DogX indicates that a dog is currently being washed.
The Dogdone X indicates that a dog has completed washing a dog.
As can be seen below, the system correctly adds one type of dog, and interacts properly with dogs of type O, but starvation is not handled properly.
This is the only feature that we can tell is not working properly. When this was tested with other cases, like multiple A's being added, starvation was
still an issue.
